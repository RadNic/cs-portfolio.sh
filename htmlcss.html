    <p class="para">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and 
    it is a series of short codes made in a text file by a person 
    or a group of people to create a language which enables
    the creation of the text on a website. People use HTML by writing tags into
    the text file, which code and perform different functions, on the
    website such as adding text to the website. HTML is written by 
    using codes and tags which translates into the words or images you see on a website. Tags are codes that make up the website and are used in HTML 
    by changing the emphasis of the words on a website. You can 
    write tags by using the less than and greater than sign. Then,
    when you enter a command in between both signs, such as p for paragraph or img to insert a picture, it creates a 
    tag that makes a change to the website. </p> <br>

  <img id="shasta" src="http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/images/2013/20130318105145-1_0.jpg"><p class="para">The creator of HTML was physicist Tim Berners-Lee. 
  While he worked at CERN as an independent contractor, he proposed 
  an idea about hypertext and how they could use it to facilitate 
  sharing and updating among researchers. In the late 1980's Berners-Lee
  left CERN and worked for the next 3 years as part of John Poole's Image 
  Computer Systems technical side which helped him learn more about computer networking.
  In 1984, he returned to CERN but as a normal guest. By 1989, CERN was the
  largest internet branch and Berners-Lee used this as an opportunity to connect
  hypertext and the internet. As a result, Berners-Lee then wrote a proposal which was 
  accepted by his manager in 1990. From there, Berners-Lee and CERN created the first ever website using only HTML and first put it online on August 16, 1991. Within this website, they explained what the world wide web was and how people could use it as well as set up their own web server.</p>
     <h3 class="head" align="center">CSS</h3> <img id="shasta" src="http://www.nerdorturd.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/css_cascading_style_sheet.jpg">
    <p class="para"> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it 
    creates the style and layout of the website by describing the
    elements of the page. They are used the same way as HTML in that 
    they use codes or tags to create the style of the page. The 
    color and font styles that you see on a website are all tags 
    of CSS that tell the website to make certain words, sentences, 
    or even the whole page a color to make them stand out. But, CSS 
    isn't just all color and font style, it is also used to insert
    links, tables, and lists within the website to help sort 
    different parts of the website. In addition, CSS can be used 
    to insert a picture and edit the location of it on the website 
    by using the padding, position, float, and align tags. These 
    tags help move the picture to a specific spot on the page. To 
    use CSS, you first need to start out with a style tag and type 
    it under the HTML tag in the third line. This style tag will 
    enable the website to realize that any code in that tag will 
    be used to "style" the page. So, let's say you want to color 
    the whole background of the page. In the style tag you would 
    need to use the code body &lt;background-color:rgb(value of red, green, and blue)&gt;.
    This code says to make the background color of the whole body, or 
    the whole page, a certain color. The reason we have either rgb or 
    basic color there is because if you want a basic, common color such
    as yellow, then you would state it after the colon after 
    background-color. But, if you wanted a specific shade of a 
    color, then you would put different values of r(ed), g(reen), 
    and b(lue) until you get the specific color that you want.</p>

     The founder and creator of CSS is Hakon Wium Lie. Lie worked with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. 
     He first proposed CSS and stlying a page on October 10, 1994. Besides 
     his proposal, there were many other proposals from other people. He thought that CSS and style sheets could allow 
     a document's style to be influenced by multiple style sheets. These sheets will then 
     translate into the different fonts and colors you see on a web page.
    As HTML grew, Lie and his partners discovered and created new tags 
    that the person could use on their website. This progress in HTML
    led to more improvements and new tags in CSS. In the early stages of CSS, there were many bugs that prevented the updates to be fully added to different browsers.
    There were 5 different CSS versions until it was fully compatible with a variety of browsers.</p></body></div>
