    <p class="para">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is a series of short codes made in a text file by a person or a group of people to create a computer language which enables the creation of a website. People use HTML by writing tags into the text file which code and perform different functions on the website such as inserting an image or adding text to the website. HTML is written by using codes and tags which translates into words and images you see on websites. Tags are codes that make up the website and are used in HTML by changing the emphasis of the words on a website. You can write tags by using the less than and greater than sign. Then, when you enter a command in between both signs, it creates a tag that makes a change to the website. Since this is HTML, its tags make the text have more emphasis by making them <strong>bold</strong> or in <em>italics</em>. </p>

    <p class="para">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it creates the style and layout of the website by describing the elements of the page. They are used the same way as HTML in that they use codes or tags to create the style of the page. The color and font styles that you see on a website are all tags of CSS that tell the website to make certain words, sentences, or even the whole page a color to make them stand out. But, CSS isn't just all color and font style, it is also used to insert links, tables, and lists within the website to help sort different parts of the website. In addition, CSS can be used to insert a picture and edit the location of it on the website by using the padding, position, float, and align tags. These tags help move the picture to a specific spot on the page. To use CSS, you first need to start out with a style tag and type it under the HTML tag in the third line. This style tag will enable the website to realize that any code in that tag will be used to "style" the page. So, let's say you want to color the whole background of the page. In the style tag you would need to use the code body{background-color:(rgb or basic color)}. This code says to make the background color of the whole body, or the whole page, a certain color. The reason we have either rgb or basic color there is because if you want a basic, common color such as yellow, then you would state it after the colon after background-color. But, if you wanted a specific shade of a color, then you would put different values of r(ed), g(reen), and b(lue) until you get the specific color that you want.</p>
