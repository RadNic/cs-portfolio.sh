    <h2 align="center" class="head">About Myself</h2> <img id="shasta" src="http://www.summitps.org/uploads/sumhome/summit_home.png">
  <p class="para">I am a 10th grader at Summit Shasta in Daly City.
  At 5' 5", I play sports and enjoy being active everyday. The 
  only time I have been out of the country was to visit my mom's 
  family in Australia, but other than that, I have only traveled 
  from state to state playing in basketball tournaments. However,
  I have not been as active as I normally due to breaking two bones
  my leg during a basketball tournament and receiving surgery. So, 
  I now have one big nail in the middle of my tibia and 3 screws 
  that keep it there. Besides basketball, I also make sure to 
  maintain good grades in school. My teammates would describe me 
  as an underrrated guard because they say that although I am 
  short, I still prove that I can stay up with all the other high 
  school players. Anyways, in school my peers and teachers
  would describe me as a hardworking, athletic, intelligent nerd.

    <p class="para">My favorite thing to do is play basketball 
    for my school and both of my club teams (AAU: Golden City SF 
    & Asian League: BAAS Dragons). I like playing basketball 
    because it helps me relieve stress from myself and gives me 
    time to calm my body. I got into basketball by watching the 
    Golden State Warriors play on TV. I would watch them everyday
    and go to games and even copy some of their moves in game and
    use them when I play. When my parents noticed that I wanted 
    to be active and be involved in a sport, they signed me up for 
    basketball camps, and from there I was placed onto teams in a 
    league and tournaments. Another one of my favorites is playing 
    video games. If I am not playing basketball, then I am most 
    likely playing video games. They help entertain me and keep 
    me occupied. I first realized how fun games were when I was 
    introduced to them by my older cousin. I would go to his house 
    and play them every Friday and I noticed how fun they were, 
    especially with other people.</p>

    <p class="para">If you haven't noticed already, one of my 
    hobbies is basketball for the same reasons as before, I use 
    it as a stress reliever and makes me calm. In addition, my 
    favorite part about basketball is the competitiveness between
    both teams in the game. I like the atmosphere and satisfacted 
    feeling I get when my team wins a tournament. Another one of 
    my hobbies is going to the gym. Just like basketball, it helps
    relieve stress and tension from my life and helps me stay fit 
    and active. Going to the gym also allows me to meet new people
    and see their routine and the results from their workout. My 
    favorite part about going to the gym is probably the fact that
    I can just go there and do any exercise I want and seeing others 
    go through their workout. Another part of the gym that makes me
    want to keep going back is the feeling I get when I am done with 
    my workout. I get a good feeling of satisfaction just knowing that 
    I strengthened certain muscles of my body.</p>
